# FlashCards Starter Kit

## Abstract

This project was completed as a part of the Mod 2 Front End Development Program. The goals of this project included learning implementation of TDD and class to class interaction through developing a flashcard game that could be fully playable in the console. 

## Setup

- Fork and clone this repo. 

- Install the library dependencies. Run:

```bash
npm install
```

- To verify that it is setup correctly, run `npm test` in your terminal.

- Running `node index.js` from the root of your project will make the game playable!
 
- You can select an answer prompt by using the arrows to move up and down the selected choices, or select a number. Hit enter once your chosen answer is highlighted.  

You will be prompted for each question, have the opportunity to select an answer, and will be given feedback. You will be able to play through the entire deck of cards:

## Reflections 

- Without having the 'luxury' of a visual component in this code base, I had a lot of difficult figuring out my next steps, and understanding how the code was connecting together. The prompts for functionality were very specific and I often misinterpreted some of what the rubric was prompting! Also, while writing the tests I often questioned whether or not the tests I wrote were effective. I did end up learning a lot about my learning style, that I am very visual- next time I am faced with this set of issues I will focus on making my own visuals!
